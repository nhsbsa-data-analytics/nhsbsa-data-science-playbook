Without good documentation, it is difficult for future projects to leverage past work.

- Consider replicating a similar structure to an R or Python package with each parameter explained, and examples of how to run the function.
- If using GitHub remember to update the README file.

At a minimum the GitHub README file should contain:

- the project name
- a quick overview of the project's purpose

Also consider including:

- a summary of the project structure
- steps to reproduce your code
- key technologies and methods used in the project
    
Remember to document anything that you tried that did not work.
