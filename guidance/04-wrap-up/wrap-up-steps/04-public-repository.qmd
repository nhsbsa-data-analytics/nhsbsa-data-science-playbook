Where applicable, we aim to generate reproducible code that is made open source. This is in line with guidance outlined in the [government service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open).

__You must check the repository does not compromise data security before making it public__.

::: {.callout-warning title="Git commit history"}
<div>
  <p>Your git commit history will be made public.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Git messages can be changed but it is advised that you follow good commit practice.</li>
    <li>Each commit should be limited to a single change.</li>
    <li>Commit history can be removed but it is not recommended as we strive to be transparent.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Never expose Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on GitHub"}
<div>
  <p>Make sure that you never push Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the GitHub repository.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Gitleaks to reduce the risk of pushing PII to Git.</li>
    <li>Never write PII directly in R scripts.</li>
    <li>Always reference PII from the database.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
