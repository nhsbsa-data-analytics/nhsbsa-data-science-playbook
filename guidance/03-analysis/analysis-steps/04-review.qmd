Work should be iteratively reviewed by everyone involved throughout the initiative. There are multiple layers of review:

- **Self Review** - Check your own work first
- **Team/Critical Friend Review** - Peer review of code and outputs
- **Data Science Lead Review** - Leadership oversight
- **Customer Review** - Validate with stakeholders

Reviews may require returning to earlier stages (data preparation, analysis, or drafting outputs).

### Standard Review Checks
Before customer review, all reviewers should:

- **Check for errors** by sense checking results and comparing to existing resources
- **Proofread text** to ensure factual accuracy and appropriate audience targeting

## Self review
Review your own work continuously, and especially before requesting reviews from others.

### Before Requesting Review:
- Ensure all points in the [QA section][analysis-and-modelling-qa] are addressed
- Sense check against the agreed [Problem Definition][problem-definition]
- Confirm customer agreement for any deviations from the PD
- Sense check reporting outputs to avoid naïve conclusions
- Run code with a 'clean slate' to ensure no local dependencies
- Consider writing repeatable tests rather than ad-hoc testing
- Document your code and methodology

### Creating Pull Requests:
- Create a PR on GitHub once happy with the code
- If building on existing work, check the code diff and add comments explaining non-obvious decisions
- Review the code diff to catch anything you missed
- Keep PRs small and focused when appropriate
- Request a code review once satisfied with your PR

Remember that your colleagues have other work; give them enough time to review your work properly.

## Team Review
One or more team members should review all code and outputs before merging to the main branch.

### Reviewer Responsibilities:
- Sense check against the [Problem Definition][problem-definition]
- Pull the code locally and run it from a 'blank slate' state
- Add comments and suggestions to the PR
- Ask the code author for clarification when needed
- Arrange a call to work through the PR together if several questions arise

## Critical Friend Review
The [Critical Friend][critical-friend] provides independent peer review throughout the project.

### Review Process:
- **Request feedback frequently** - Always before customer reviews
- **Validate against the Problem Definition** - Ensure alignment with agreed scope
- **Review from multiple perspectives**:
  - As the customer viewing outputs
  - As a developer using the codebase
- **Review holistically** - Not just the code, but the entire work
- **Discuss complex feedback** - Arrange calls when needed

## Customer Review
Involve customers frequently throughout the initiative.

### During Development:
- **Share draft outputs** for review in their own time (not just screen sharing)
- **Be available for calls** to discuss their feedback
- **Address questions and suggestions** openly

### Final Presentation:
When the initiative is completed, present findings to the customer and:

- Ensure they understand how to use interactive elements (e.g., dashboards)
- Discuss potential for future related work
- Send a follow-up survey (if appropriate) to confirm all needs were met
