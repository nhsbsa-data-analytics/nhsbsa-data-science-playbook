Before beginning to work on your problem definition, you will need to update JIRA and setup a GitHub repository to store and monitor code. 

# Setting up the resources

-	Remember to set the new GitHub repository to private.
-	Invite relevant Data Science team members as collaborators and grant the wider team read access.  
-	Code should be written to a professional standard under the proviso it could be made public.

**You must check the repository does not compromise data security before making it public**

::: {.callout-warning title="Git commit history"}
<div>
  <p>Your git commit history will be made public.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Git messages can be changed but it is advised that you follow good commit practice.</li>
    <li>Each commit should be limited to a single change.</li>
    <li>Commit history can be removed but it is not recommended as we strive to be transparent.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Never expose Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on GitHub"}
<div>
  <p>Make sure that you never push Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the GitHub repository.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Git Leaks to reduce the risk of pushing PII to Git.</li>
    <li>Never write PII directly in R scripts.</li>
    <li>Always reference PII from the database.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::


Further guidance on setting up resources can be found on the internal Data Science Wiki.
After creating all resources, remember to:

-	provide regular updates to the JIRA ticket
-	regularly push code additions and alterations to the GitHub repository
