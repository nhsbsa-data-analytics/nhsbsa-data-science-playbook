## What is a Critical Friend?
A Critical Friend is an independent colleague who peer-reviews your work throughout the project. They ensure:

- the [Problem Definition][problem-definition] meets customer needs
- the project answers the right questions  
- the project uses appropriate methods and draws correct conclusions
- outputs are coherent and consistent with previous results and other sources
- outputs are accurate, quality-checked and reproducible
- the work solves the original problem

They also provide a fresh perspective to catch issues the team may have missed.

The Critical Friend is also known as the **Analytical Assurer**. For more details, see the [NHSBSA Producing Quality Analysis Playbook][nhsbsa-qa-playbook] and [The AquA book][aqua-book-roles].

## Working with your Critical Friend
Involve the Critical Friend throughout the **entire project**, from the [Problem Definition][problem-definition] through to delivery:

- **Meet regularly** to keep them updated on progress
- **Review iteratively** in small increments, not all at once at the end
- **Plan ahead** by including their involvement in your project timeline
- **Give notice** and respect their availability when requesting reviews

## How to Assign a Critical Friend

1. **Assign early** – ideally during the Problem Definition stage
2. **Contact** the Data Science team or Data Science Lead for recommendations
3. **Choose wisely**:
   - Ideally someone with experience in similar data or techniques
   - If you're the area expert, consider a newer team member to help them gain experience
