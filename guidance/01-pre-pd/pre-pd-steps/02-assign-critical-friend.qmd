## What is a critical friend?
- Typical Data Science initiatives involve 1-2 people working on the project.
- For each project undertaken by a single team member a critical friend is assigned.
- For group projects a critical friend is not mandatory but is advised. Where not allocated, group members must inherit the responsibilities of a critical friend through peer review.
- A critical friend reviews the problem definition, business understanding and outputs.
- The critical friend provides a fresh perspective and offers the opportunity to catch issues that are overlooked by the team. - They can also attend meetings, check documents and provide extra support and guidance throughout the initiative.

Towards the end of an initiative ask other team members to review the output.


## Assigning a critical friend

- Assign a critical friend **as early as possible**.
- Critical friends are assigned by the project members or the Data Science Lead.
- The Data Science Lead knows who is available and has valuable knowledge related to the upcoming project.
- Ideally, a critical friend should have prior experience with similar data or techniques.
- If you are an area expert, you can choose a new team member as the critical friend so they can gain experience.

## Working with your critical friend

- The critical friend will help by offering more insight and reviewing the project.
- Regularly meet with the critical friend to keep them updated.
- Assign work to review in small increments rather than all at once.
- Respect the critical friendâ€™s diary and provide plenty of notice for work to be completed.
