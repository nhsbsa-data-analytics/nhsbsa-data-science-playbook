## What is a Critical Friend?
A Critical Friend is a colleague who provides independent peer-review to ensure:
- the [Problem Definition][problem-definition] meets customer needs
- the project aims to answer the right questions 
- the project applies appropriate methods and draws the correct conclusions
- the outputs are coherent and consistent with previous results and other sources of information
- the outputs are accurate, have been quality checked and are reproducible
- the work solves the original problem outlined in the [Problem Definition][problem-definition]

The Critical Friend also provides a fresh perspective and offers the opportunity to catch issues that may have been overlooked by the team. 

For more details on the role of the Critical Friend (also known as the __Analytical Assurer__) in analytical work, see the [NHSBSA Producing Quality Analysis Playbook][nhsbsa-qa-playbook] 
and [The AquA book][aqua-book-roles]. 

## Working with your Critical Friend
The Critical Friend should be involved throughout the **entire project**, from drafting the [Problem Definition][problem-definition] through to delivery:
- The Critical Friend will help by offering more insight and reviewing the project.
- Regularly meet with the Critical Friend to keep them updated.
- Reviews should happen iteratively in small increments throughout the project, rather than all at once at the end.
- Make sure your project plan accounts for the Critical Friend's involvement.
- Respect the Critical Friend’s diary and provide plenty of notice for work to be completed.

## Assigning a Critical Friend

- Assign a Critical Friend **as early as possible**
- Reach out to the Data Science team or the Data Science Lead to identify the right colleague to act as Critical Friend
- Ideally, a Critical Friend should have prior experience with similar data or techniques.
- If you are an area expert, you can choose a new team member as the Critical Friend so they can gain experience.
