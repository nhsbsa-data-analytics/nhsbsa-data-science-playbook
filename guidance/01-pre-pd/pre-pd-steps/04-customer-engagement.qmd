It is important to meet with the customer to discuss requirements. This may happen before and/or after you develop initial business and data understanding. During this meeting, you can identify:

-	in more detail what they are looking to do within the initiative
-	what outputs they are expecting to see, in which format
-	any business knowledge or insights they can provide to aid your work
-	any data limitations and possible solutions
-	if there are any additional data sources to be considered
-	the required timescales 

This meeting is important, as it can help to refine the problem definition within [section 2](../../02-pd/index.qmd).

## General considerations

-	If you have any questions for the customer send them prior to the meeting. If you encountered any data issues, some examples could also help them prepare answers.
-	If the work is particularly urgent, more colleagues and resource can be assigned accordingly.
-	Some customers will have busy schedules so it is important to setup the meeting in advance so the project can progress.
-	Your critical friend should attend the meeting to share knowledge and be clear on the scope of the project.
-	Document any actions agreed at the meeting.
-	Set up recurring follow up meetings at regular intervals.
-	Any open questions following the meeting should be chased using either Teams or email.
