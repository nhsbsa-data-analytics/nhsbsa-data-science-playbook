## Accessing data

-	Temporary access must be requested via email or a service request and is subject to approval from the Data Science Lead, Database administrators and/or Data Asset Owner.
-	Should sensitive data be needed, there may also be a requirement to engage with the Caldicott Guardian and/or Information Governance.
-	All non-public domain data must be accessed and processed within the Data Science secure data environment.
-	Also request any relevant metadata, data dictionaries and data quality profiles. See the internal Data Science Wiki for more information.   

## Initial data understanding

Initial data understanding will help you to gauge what is possible with the data including any anomalies, caveats, and quality issues. Further information can be found in [Section 3](../../03-analysis/index.qmd) of the playbook.  

-	Use data documentation and identify data subject matter expert (SMEs) (within the services and/or central MI or Data Services) who will support you to understand what fields are available and their suitability.
-	Initial exploratory data analysis will also help you to get a better feel for the data in terms of its quality and suitability and what data preparation might be required.
-	Should documentation not exist, you may wish to record:
    - a summary of what each column represents
    -	the number of missing records
    -	the number of errors
    -	if applicable, the logic used to calculate the column

Combined with business understanding, this initial analysis will help to:

-	inform the problem definition (PD)
-	inform conversations with the customer of what is possible and not possible to achieve during the initiative
-	identify other interesting research questions with the customer and explore if these are worth pursuing

## Usage

Further advice on usage of specific databases can be found within the internal Data Science Wiki.

## Desk research and business understanding

Desk research and business understanding will help you understand what is possible for the initiative and ensure the work is not duplicated.

To assist your work you could use:

-	JIRA as a reference to previous initiatives
-	reports and other outputs from previous initiatives in the project folders
-	other team members, business SMEs and your critical friend to help develop business knowledge
-	user research where applicable
-	internal and external online resources which may describe the service, policy or other aspects relevant to understanding context
-	externally or internal published statistics, data or dashboards relevant to the subject. They may also later be a source for validation and ensuring coherence.
-	resources to support with methodology such as Github repositories, Stack Overflow, Medium and research papers
-	DataCamp to complete relevant courses

This is a guide of what is possible and is dependent on the current project’s requirements.

## User research

Incorporating user research into data science projects allows the team to provide actionable insights through advanced analytics, improve patient and customer outcomes, and reduce system loss. By collaborating with the wider NHSBSA, NHS England, and external organisations, we ensure our solutions meet user needs and drive innovation.

User research is integrated into the data science projects by:

- **using qualitative research methods** such as surveys, focus groups, and interviews to understand user problems and pain points when using NHS services
- **using user insights** to determine important features, enhancing model accuracy and relevance
- **establishing user-defined success metrics** to measure the effectiveness of our models and analytics
- **designing models based on real-world use cases**, ensuring they meet user expectations and improve outcomes
- **enhancing usability and accessibility** of tools like NHSBSA branded R Shiny and Power BI dashboards based on user feedback
- **conducting usability testing** to refine models and solutions using user feedback based on prototypes
- **building personalised recommendations and insights** that adapt to user preferences
- **facilitating better communication** by bridging the gap between data scientists and end-users
- **identifying impactful projects** that should be prioritised and allocated the appropriate resources
