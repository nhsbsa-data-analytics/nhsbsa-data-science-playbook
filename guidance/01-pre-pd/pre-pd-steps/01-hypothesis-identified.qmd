The Data Science team deliver [actionable insights](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/data-science-projects) from data through **innovation**, **experimentation** and **collaboration**. This drives policy, decision making and efficiencies across the NHSBSA and wider health and social care system. Projects typically align to the following areas:

-	help identify health and care disparities
-	improve patient and customer outcomes 
-	improve employee outcomes
-	reduce loss in the system

## Selecting a project

- Projects can be identified by Data Science team members, an internal NHSBSA customer, an external customer, user research or recommendations from previous work. 
-	They may also be identified through collaborative ideas sessions we run with other teams.
- Customers can request work through the Data Science Lead, team members or [dall@nhsbsa.nhs.uk](mailto:dall@nhsbsa.nhs.uk).
-	The Data Science team and internal customers can also log ideas for future projects on the ideas register.
-	The Data Science Lead reviews projects for suitability in terms of scope and appropriateness, as well as any ethical implications. Projects may be triaged to other teams if not suitable.
-	The Data Science Lead coordinates the assignment of initiatives to team members as well as critical friends.
-	Once a project is accepted, it is initially created in JIRA, with initiative number and basic project information including project lead, team members and critical friend. The Data Science initiative number is identified using JIRA. 
-	A SharePoint folder is created to store documents and data using the template provided. The initiative number is included in the name.
