Customer feedback may highlight different angles to explore or amendments to the PD before the customer can sign off.

-	It is important to repeat the problem definition loop again until the customer is happy to proceed.
-	In rare cases, feedback may highlight that the initiative may not be possible in the way that the customer initially intended.
-	Unless any suitable alternatives are identified, the project may not be feasible.
-	In this case, you **must** discuss your concerns with the Data Science Lead before communicating this with the customer.
