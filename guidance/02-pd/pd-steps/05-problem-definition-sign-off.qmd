The customer should sign-off the problem definition before the initiative can be continued. In some cases however, preliminary work can be continued prior to sign-off.

Optionally, a final meeting can be held with the customer to agree the direction of research.

Ensure there is a record of the problem definition being signed-off, such as in a follow-up email after the final meeting or in a Teams message.
