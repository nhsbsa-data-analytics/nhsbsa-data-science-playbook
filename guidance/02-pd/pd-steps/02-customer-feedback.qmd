After finishing your draft of the problem definition communicate with the customer to receive their feedback. How you get the feedback will depend on customer; it may be via Teams call, chat, or email.

- Make sure the customer is aware of any limitations.
- Get an agreement on the proposed output or any changes that are needed.

However you get the feedback, keep a record of what was discussed and any agreements and update JIRA.
