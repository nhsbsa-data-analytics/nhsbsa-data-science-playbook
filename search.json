It is important to note that different analysts will consider the analytical problem differently, potentially resulting in differing results, however if any one approach is repeated the results should be as expected.\nIndependent: To produce analysis that is free of prejudice or bias. In doing so, care should be taken to appropriately balance the views across all stakeholders and experts.\nGrounded in reality: Quality analysis takes the commissioner and analyst on a journey as views and perceptions are challenged and connections are made between the analysis and its real consequences. Connecting with reality in this way guards against failing to properly grasp the context of the problem which is being analysed.\nObjective: Effective engagement and suitable challenge reduces potential bias and enables the commissioner and the analyst to be clear about the interpretation of the analytical results.\nUncertainty-managed: Uncertainties have been identified, managed, and communicated throughout the analytical process.\nRobust: Provide the analytical result in the context of residual uncertainty and limitations to ensure it is used appropriately.\n\nSee the internal Data Science Wiki for guides and links to resources on specific methods.",

Most initiatives will also have some element of coding involved, even when using low-or-no-code tools like Power BI.\n\nUse Github to handle version control, issues and code reviews.\nIn Python, use object-oriented programming (OOP) if you can. Please see the internal Data Science Wiki for information.\nAlthough R does have support for OOP, it is not a big paradigm like in Python.\nBe careful of premature optimisation (called out by computer scientist Donald Knuth as ‘the root of all evil’ in software development).\nStart small, such as limiting data to a manageable subset when developing the analysis; this makes it easier to spot issues and allows for faster iteration of code.\nCheck the data looks correct at each step of reshaping and transforming it; better still, know what it should be before writing and applying the step (the principle behind test driven development, TDD).\nWork on one component of output at a time, for example using shiny with the modular golem framework, as in our shiny app template.\nFrequently run code as you write it, or check the output for low-or-no-code tools, so any issues are encountered early and their source is clearer.\nYou may produce multiple smaller data sets to be used in your outputs; the considerations applying to base tables apply equally to these.\nWhere appropriate, the final code should use RAP principles.",
